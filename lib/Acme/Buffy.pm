=head1 NAME

Acme::Buffy - An encoding scheme for Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Acme::Buffy;

  print "Hello world";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The first time you run a program under C<use Acme::Buffy>, the module
removes most of the unsightly characters from your source file.  The
code continues to work exactly as it did before, but now it looks like
this:

  use Acme::Buffy;
  BUffY bUFFY BUffY bUFFY bUfFy buffy BUFfy	buFFY BufFy	BufFY	bUFfy BuFFY buffy	bufFy bUffy bUffY BuFfy	BuffY	bUFfy BUfFY BUFFy	Buffy bUffY	
  BuFFY BUFFy	BufFy BUFfy BUfFY buFfy	BuffY	BuFfy	BUfFY bUffy	buFFy	BUffy	bUffy 

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 C<Can't buffy '%s'>

Acme::Buffy could not access the source file to modify it.

=head2 C<Can't rebuffy '%s'>

Acme::Buffy could not access the source file to execute it.

This was based on Damian Conway's Bleach module and was inspired by an
idea by Philip Newton. I blame London Perl Mongers too...

Yes, the namespace B<was> named after me. Maybe.
